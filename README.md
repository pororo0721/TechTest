# Coding exercise -prime tables

## Instructions
- For the programming language, please use JavaScript.
-  You should have a test for a performant prime algorithm that can generate a list of 
primes.
- We recommend small commits to git so that we can see how you’ve developed your 
solution.
-  We recommend writing your application with high unit test coverage.
-  For the input and output you can use the console, a web page, or something else.
- Please write an algorithm to solve the prime number generation. Do not use a library 
method to generate your primes.
-  You should input a whole number N, where is N is at least 1.
-  The application should output an N+1 x N+1 grid of numbers.


## Explanation
-  How to run it. 
-  What you’re pleased with. 
-  What you would do with it if you had more time.
